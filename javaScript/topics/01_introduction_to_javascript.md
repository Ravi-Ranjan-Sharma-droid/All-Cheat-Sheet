# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that runs in browsers and Node.js environments. It's the language of the web and enables interactive, dynamic websites.

## Key Characteristics
- **Dynamically typed**: Variables don't need explicit type declarations
- **Interpreted**: No compilation step required
- **Event-driven**: Responds to user interactions and system events
- **Prototype-based**: Objects can inherit directly from other objects

## Where JavaScript Runs
- **Frontend**: Browsers (Chrome V8, Firefox SpiderMonkey, Safari JavaScriptCore)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Deno, Bun
- **Mobile**: React Native, Ionic
- **Desktop**: Electron

## Pro Tips
- Use browser developer tools for debugging (F12)
- Enable strict mode with `'use strict';` for better error catching
- JavaScript is case-sensitive: `myVariable` â‰  `myvariable`
