  dig google.com         # More detailed DNS information
  host google.com        # Simple DNS lookup
  ```

* **Network Configuration**:
  ```bash
  ip addr show           # Show IP addresses and interfaces
  ip route               # Show routing table
  ip link show           # Show network interfaces
  ```

* **Network Connections**:
  ```bash
  ss -tuln               # Show listening ports
  netstat -tuln          # Alternative to ss
  lsof -i                # List open network files
  ```

* **Packet Capture**:
  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0   # Capture packets on interface eth0
  ```

### GUI Tools

* **Wireshark**: Detailed packet analysis
* **Network Manager**: GUI for network configuration on Linux

## Common Issue 1: "No Internet Connection"

### Scenario

You're connected to your network, but you can't access any websites or online services.

### Troubleshooting Steps

#### 1. Check Physical Connections

* Verify all cables are properly connected
* Check if router/modem lights are normal
* Try a different Ethernet cable if applicable

#### 2. Verify Local Network Connectivity

```bash
# Check if you have an IP address
ip addr show

# Try to ping your router
ping 192.168.1.1  # Replace with your router's IP
```

#### 3. Check DNS Resolution

```bash
# Try to ping a domain
ping google.com

# If that fails, try pinging by IP
ping 8.8.8.8
```

If pinging by IP works but pinging by domain name fails, you have a DNS issue.

#### 4. Test DNS Resolution

```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup google.com

# Try using a different DNS server
nslookup google.com 1.1.1.1
```

#### 5. Check Default Gateway

```bash
# View routing table
ip route

# Ensure you have a default route
ip route | grep default
```

#### 6. Restart Network Services

```bash
# Restart NetworkManager on Linux
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

# Release and renew DHCP lease
sudo dhclient -r && sudo dhclient
```

## FAQ

### Q: How can I tell if my internet problem is with my equipment or my ISP?
**A:** Follow this process: 1) Check if multiple devices have the same issue (if only one device is affected, the problem is likely with that device); 2) Restart your router and modem to rule out temporary glitches; 3) Connect a computer directly to the modem (bypassing your router) to see if that resolves the issue; 4) Check if neighbors with the same ISP are experiencing problems; 5) Use a mobile hotspot to verify if websites/services are actually up. If the problem persists after steps 1-3, especially if neighbors have similar issues, it's likely an ISP problem. Call your ISP and ask if there are known outages in your area.

### Q: Why does rebooting the router fix so many problems?
**A:** Rebooting a router clears its memory and forces it to reload all configurations, which resolves many common issues: 1) It clears the RAM, which may be experiencing memory leaks or fragmentation after running for long periods; 2) It reestablishes connections with your ISP, potentially getting a new IP address if there were IP conflicts; 3) It forces the router to update its routing tables and DNS cache; 4) It restarts any services that might have crashed or become unresponsive; 5) It can clear overheating issues by temporarily powering down the hardware. While rebooting often works, frequent need for reboots indicates an underlying problem that should be addressed.

### Q: What's the difference between a network issue and an application issue?
**A:** Distinguishing between network and application issues requires systematic testing: 1) If multiple applications have the same problem, it's likely a network issue; 2) If only one application is affected while others work fine, it's probably an application issue; 3) If you can ping servers and resolve DNS but specific services don't work, it's likely application-related; 4) If the issue occurs on multiple devices, it points to a network problem; 5) Application issues often present specific error messages, while network issues typically show as timeouts or connection failures. Testing the same application on a different network (like mobile data) can help confirm whether the problem is with the application or your network.

### Q: How can I improve my Wi-Fi performance without buying new equipment?
**A:** Several free optimizations can significantly improve Wi-Fi performance: 1) Reposition your router to a central, elevated location away from obstructions and interference sources; 2) Change your Wi-Fi channel to avoid congestion (use a Wi-Fi analyzer app to find less crowded channels); 3) Update your router's firmware to get performance improvements and bug fixes; 4) Secure your network with a strong password to prevent unauthorized users from consuming bandwidth; 5) Disable unused features like guest networks or IoT-specific networks if you don't need them; 6) Schedule automatic reboots of your router (many have this feature built-in); 7) If your router supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, connect devices that need higher speeds to the 5GHz network.

### Q: What should I do when my internet is consistently slower than what I'm paying for?
**A:** If you're not getting the speeds you're paying for: 1) Run multiple speed tests at different times of day using reliable services like speedtest.net; 2) Test with a wired connection to eliminate Wi-Fi variables; 3) Try different devices to rule out device-specific issues; 4) Document your findings with screenshots or logs; 5) Check your service agreement for phrases like "up to" which indicate maximum, not guaranteed speeds; 6) Contact your ISP with your evidence and ask for troubleshooting; 7) If they can't resolve it, ask for a plan adjustment to match actual speeds or consider switching providers; 8) As a last resort, check if your local consumer protection agency can help with ISP disputes.
