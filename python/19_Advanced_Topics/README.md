# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced Python topics that will help you take your Python skills to the next level. These concepts are essential for writing efficient, maintainable, and robust Python code for complex applications.

## Iterators and Iterables

Iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol, which consists of the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. Iterables are objects that can be iterated over, like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

### Iterables vs. Iterators

An **iterable** is an object that can be iterated over, like a list or a string. It implements the `__iter__()` method, which returns an iterator.

An **iterator** is an object that keeps track of the current position in a sequence and knows how to get the next item. It implements both `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.

```python
# List is an iterable
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Get an iterator from the list
my_iterator = iter(my_list)  # This calls my_list.__iter__()

# Use the iterator to get items one by one
print(next(my_iterator))  # 1 (This calls my_iterator.__next__())
print(next(my_iterator))  # 2
print(next(my_iterator))  # 3

# This will raise StopIteration exception
try:
    print(next(my_iterator))
except StopIteration:
    print("No more items!")
```

### Creating Custom Iterators

You can create your own iterators by implementing the iterator protocol.

```python
class Countdown:
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.start = start
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.start <= 0:
            raise StopIteration
        self.start -= 1
        return self.start + 1

# Usage
for num in Countdown(5):
    print(num)  # Prints: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

### Creating Custom Iterables

You can also create custom iterables by implementing just the `__iter__()` method that returns an iterator.

```python
class EvenNumbers:
    def __init__(self, max_num):
        self.max_num = max_num
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return EvenNumbersIterator(self.max_num)

class EvenNumbersIterator:
    def __init__(self, max_num):
        self.current = 0
        self.max_num = max_num
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.current >= self.max_num:
            raise StopIteration
        self.current += 2
        return self.current - 2

# Usage
for num in EvenNumbers(10):
    print(num)  # Prints: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
```

### Benefits of Iterators

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Iterators compute values on-demand, which can save memory when working with large datasets.
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Values are computed only when needed, which can improve performance.
3. **Infinite Sequences**: Iterators can represent infinite sequences, as they only generate values as requested.

### Iterator Tools

The `itertools` module provides a collection of tools for working with iterators.

```python
import itertools

# Count indefinitely from a starting value
for i in itertools.count(10):
    print(i)  # 10, 11, 12, ...
    if i >= 15:
        break

# Cycle through an iterable indefinitely
for i in itertools.cycle([1, 2, 3]):
    print(i)  # 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...
    if i == 3:
        break

# Repeat an element a specific number of times
for i in itertools.repeat(5, 3):
    print(i)  # 5, 5, 5

# Chain multiple iterables together
for i in itertools.chain([1, 2], [3, 4]):
    print(i)  # 1, 2, 3, 4

# Generate all combinations of a specified length
for combo in itertools.combinations([1, 2, 3, 4], 2):
    print(combo)  # (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)

# Generate all permutations of a specified length
for perm in itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3], 2):
    print(perm)  # (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)

# Generate all combinations with replacement
for combo in itertools.combinations_with_replacement([1, 2, 3], 2):
    print(combo)  # (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)
```

## Context Managers

Context managers are objects that define the methods `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`. They are designed to be used with the `with` statement to ensure that resources are properly managed.

### The `with` Statement

The `with` statement is used to wrap the execution of a block of code with methods defined by a context manager. It ensures that cleanup code is executed, even if an exception is raised.

```python
# Using a file as a context manager
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
# File is automatically closed when the block exits
```

### Creating Context Managers Using Classes

You can create your own context managers by implementing the `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods.

```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"Entering {self.name}")
        return self  # The value returned by __enter__ is assigned to the variable after 'as'
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print(f"Exiting {self.name}")
        # Return True to suppress exceptions, False to propagate them
        return False

# Usage
with MyContextManager("example") as cm:
    print("Inside the context")
    # raise ValueError("An error occurred")  # Uncomment to see exception handling
```

### Creating Context Managers Using `contextlib`

The `contextlib` module provides utilities for working with context managers, including the `@contextmanager` decorator, which allows you to create context managers using generator functions.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def my_context_manager(name):
    print(f"Entering {name}")
    try:
        yield name  # The value yielded is assigned to the variable after 'as'
    finally:
        print(f"Exiting {name}")

# Usage
with my_context_manager("example") as name:
    print(f"Inside the context with {name}")
    # raise ValueError("An error occurred")  # Uncomment to see exception handling
```

### Nested Context Managers

Context managers can be nested, and they will be entered and exited in the expected order (LIFO - Last In, First Out).

```python
with open('file1.txt', 'r') as file1, open('file2.txt', 'w') as file2:
    content = file1.read()
    file2.write(content)
```

### Common Use Cases for Context Managers

1. **Resource Management**: Ensuring resources like files, network connections, or database connections are properly closed.
2. **Locking**: Acquiring and releasing locks for thread synchronization.
3. **Timing**: Measuring the execution time of a block of code.
4. **Temporary Changes**: Making temporary changes to the environment or state that are reverted afterward.

```python
# Example: Timing context manager
import time
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def timing():
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution took {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds")

# Usage
with timing():
    # Code to be timed
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing

Python provides two main approaches for concurrent execution: multithreading and multiprocessing. Understanding the differences and when to use each is crucial for writing efficient concurrent code.

### The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at once. This means that even on multi-core systems, only one thread can execute Python code at a time.

The GIL has significant implications for multithreaded Python programs:
- CPU-bound tasks don't benefit much from multithreading due to the GIL.
- I/O-bound tasks can still benefit from multithreading, as the GIL is released during I/O operations.

### Multithreading

Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads run concurrently within the same process, sharing the same memory space.

```python
import threading
import time

def worker(name):
    print(f"Worker {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate I/O-bound work
    print(f"Worker {name} finished")

# Create and start threads
threads = []
for i in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print("All workers finished")
```

#### Thread Synchronization

When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization is necessary to prevent race conditions.

```python
import threading

# Shared resource
counter = 0

# Lock for synchronization
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        with lock:  # Acquire and release the lock
            counter += 1

# Create and start threads
threads = []
for _ in range(5):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=increment)
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print(f"Counter: {counter}")  # Should be 500000
```

#### Thread Pools

The `concurrent.futures` module provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables using threads or processes.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time

def worker(name):
    print(f"Worker {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate I/O-bound work
    return f"Worker {name} result"

# Using a thread pool
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    # Submit tasks and get Future objects
    futures = [executor.submit(worker, i) for i in range(5)]
    
    # Get results as they complete
    for future in futures:
        print(future.result())
```

### Multiprocessing

Multiprocessing is a technique where multiple processes run concurrently, each with its own memory space. This bypasses the GIL and allows true parallel execution on multi-core systems.

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def worker(name):
    print(f"Worker {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate CPU-bound work
    print(f"Worker {name} finished")

if __name__ == "__main__":  # This guard is important for Windows
    # Create and start processes
    processes = []
    for i in range(5):
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(i,))
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()
    
    # Wait for all processes to complete
    for process in processes:
        process.join()
    
    print("All workers finished")
```

#### Process Pools

The `multiprocessing` module provides a `Pool` class for parallel execution of functions across multiple input values.

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
import time

def worker(name):
    print(f"Worker {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate CPU-bound work
    return f"Worker {name} result"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Using a process pool
    with Pool(processes=5) as pool:
        # Map function to inputs
        results = pool.map(worker, range(5))
        
        # Print results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
```

#### Sharing Data Between Processes

Processes don't share memory by default, but the `multiprocessing` module provides several ways to share data.

```python
from multiprocessing import Process, Queue, Value, Array

def worker(q, counter, data):
    # Get data from the queue
    item = q.get()
    print(f"Got {item} from queue")
    
    # Update shared counter
    with counter.get_lock():
        counter.value += 1
    
    # Update shared array
    for i in range(len(data)):
        data[i] = data[i] * 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create shared objects
    queue = Queue()
    counter = Value('i', 0)  # 'i' is the type code for integer
    data = Array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Shared array of integers
    
    # Put data in the queue
    queue.put(42)
    
    # Create and start a process
    process = Process(target=worker, args=(queue, counter, data))
    process.start()
    process.join()
    
    # Check the results
    print(f"Counter: {counter.value}")  # Should be 1
    print(f"Data: {list(data)}")  # Should be [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### When to Use Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing

- **Use Multithreading for**:
  - I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network requests, file operations)
  - Tasks that spend most of their time waiting for external events
  - When you need to share memory between tasks
  - When you need to create a large number of workers (threads are lighter than processes)

- **Use Multiprocessing for**:
  - CPU-bound tasks (e.g., number crunching, image processing)
  - Tasks that need to bypass the GIL for true parallelism
  - When task isolation is important (each process has its own memory space)
  - When you need to utilize multiple CPU cores

### Hybrid Approaches

For complex applications, you might use a combination of multithreading and multiprocessing.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor
import time

def io_bound_task(name):
    print(f"IO-bound task {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate I/O-bound work
    return f"IO-bound task {name} result"

def cpu_bound_task(name):
    print(f"CPU-bound task {name} starting")
    # Simulate CPU-bound work
    result = 0
    for i in range(10000000):
        result += i
    return f"CPU-bound task {name} result: {result}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Use threads for I/O-bound tasks
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as thread_executor:
        io_futures = [thread_executor.submit(io_bound_task, i) for i in range(5)]
    
    # Use processes for CPU-bound tasks
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as process_executor:
        cpu_futures = [process_executor.submit(cpu_bound_task, i) for i in range(5)]
    
    # Get results from I/O-bound tasks
    for future in io_futures:
        print(future.result())
    
    # Get results from CPU-bound tasks
    for future in cpu_futures:
        print(future.result())
```

## Memory Optimization

Python's automatic memory management is convenient, but understanding how memory is used and optimizing memory usage is important for large-scale applications.

### Understanding Python's Memory Management

Python uses reference counting and a garbage collector to manage memory:

- **Reference Counting**: Each object keeps track of how many references point to it. When the count reaches zero, the object is deallocated.
- **Garbage Collection**: Periodically checks for reference cycles (objects that reference each other but are not reachable from the root) and cleans them up.

### Memory Profiling

Before optimizing memory usage, it's important to understand where memory is being used. The `memory_profiler` module can help with this.

```python
# Install with: pip install memory_profiler
from memory_profiler import profile

@profile
def memory_intensive_function():
    # Create a large list
    large_list = [i for i in range(10000000)]
    # Do something with the list
    result = sum(large_list)
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    memory_intensive_function()
```

### Reducing Memory Usage

#### Use Generators Instead of Lists

Generators compute values on-demand, which can save memory when working with large datasets.

```python
# Memory-intensive (creates a large list in memory)
def get_squares_list(n):
    return [i**2 for i in range(n)]

# Memory-efficient (generates values on-demand)
def get_squares_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i**2

# Usage
for square in get_squares_generator(1000000):
    # Process each square without storing all of them in memory
    pass
```

#### Use `__slots__` for Classes with Many Instances

The `__slots__` attribute can significantly reduce memory usage for classes with many instances by avoiding the creation of a `__dict__` for each instance.

```python
# Regular class (more memory usage)
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

# Memory-efficient class
class PointWithSlots:
    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')
    
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

# Create many instances
regular_points = [Point(i, i) for i in range(1000000)]
slots_points = [PointWithSlots(i, i) for i in range(1000000)]

# The slots_points list will use significantly less memory
```

#### Use NumPy for Numerical Data

NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient than Python lists for numerical data.

```python
import numpy as np

# Python list (more memory usage)
python_list = [i for i in range(1000000)]

# NumPy array (less memory usage)
numpy_array = np.arange(1000000)

# Operations on numpy_array will also be faster
result = numpy_array * 2
```

#### Use `array` Module for Homogeneous Data

The `array` module provides a space-efficient way to store homogeneous data.

```python
import array

# Create an array of integers
int_array = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Create an array of floats
float_array = array.array('d', [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5])
```

#### Use `collections.deque` for Queue Operations

The `deque` (double-ended queue) from the `collections` module is more efficient than lists for queue operations.

```python
from collections import deque

# Create a deque
queue = deque([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Add to the right
queue.append(6)

# Add to the left
queue.appendleft(0)

# Remove from the right
right_item = queue.pop()

# Remove from the left
left_item = queue.popleft()
```

#### Use `weakref` for Weak References

Weak references allow you to refer to an object without increasing its reference count, which can help prevent memory leaks in certain scenarios.

```python
import weakref

class ExpensiveObject:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __del__(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is being deleted")

# Create an object
obj = ExpensiveObject("my_object")

# Create a weak reference to the object
weak_ref = weakref.ref(obj)

# Access the object through the weak reference
print(weak_ref().name)  # Prints: my_object

# Delete the original reference
del obj

# The object is now deleted, and the weak reference returns None
print(weak_ref())  # Prints: None
```

#### Use `contextlib.closing` for Proper Resource Cleanup

The `closing` context manager ensures that resources are properly closed, which can prevent memory leaks.

```python
from contextlib import closing
import urllib.request

# Using closing to ensure the connection is closed
with closing(urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.example.com')) as page:
    content = page.read()

# The connection is automatically closed when the block exits
```

### Memory Leaks

Memory leaks can occur in Python, especially in long-running applications. Common causes include:

1. **Circular References**: Objects that reference each other but are not reachable from the root.
2. **Global Variables**: Objects stored in global variables persist for the lifetime of the program.
3. **Caches**: Objects stored in caches that are not properly managed.
4. **Event Handlers**: Objects that register event handlers but don't unregister them.

#### Detecting Memory Leaks

The `objgraph` module can help detect memory leaks by visualizing object references.

```python
# Install with: pip install objgraph
import objgraph

# Show the most common types
objgraph.show_most_common_types()

# Find what's referencing a specific object
objgraph.show_backrefs([obj], filename='backrefs.png')

# Find what a specific object is referencing
objgraph.show_refs([obj], filename='refs.png')
```

#### Preventing Memory Leaks

1. **Use Weak References**: Use weak references for callbacks and caches.
2. **Limit Cache Sizes**: Use `functools.lru_cache` or similar mechanisms to limit cache sizes.
3. **Unregister Event Handlers**: Always unregister event handlers when they are no longer needed.
4. **Use Context Managers**: Use context managers for resource management.
5. **Avoid Circular References**: Be aware of potential circular references and break them when necessary.

```python
import weakref

class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers = []
    
    def register_observer(self, observer):
        # Use weak references for observers
        self.observers.append(weakref.ref(observer))
    
    def notify_observers(self):
        # Filter out dead references and notify live ones
        live_observers = []
        for observer_ref in self.observers:
            observer = observer_ref()
            if observer is not None:
                observer.update()
                live_observers.append(observer_ref)
        self.observers = live_observers

class Observer:
    def __init__(self, subject):
        self.subject = subject
        subject.register_observer(self)
    
    def update(self):
        print("Observer updated")
```

## Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming is the practice of writing code that manipulates or generates other code. Python provides several features for metaprogramming, including decorators, metaclasses, and dynamic attribute access.

### Decorators

Decorators are a form of metaprogramming that allows you to modify the behavior of functions or classes.

```python
def log_calls(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_calls
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Usage
result = add(2, 3)  # Logs the call and the result
```

### Metaclasses

Metaclasses are classes that define how other classes are created. They allow you to customize class creation.

```python
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs):
        # Add a new method to the class
        attrs['speak'] = lambda self: f"{name} says hello"
        return super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, attrs)

class Dog(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

class Cat(metaclass=Meta):
    pass

# Usage
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
print(dog.speak())  # Dog says hello
print(cat.speak())  # Cat says hello
```

### Dynamic Attribute Access

Python allows you to customize attribute access using special methods like `__getattr__`, `__setattr__`, and `__delattr__`.

```python
class DynamicAttributes:
    def __init__(self):
        self._attributes = {}
    
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        if name in self._attributes:
            return self._attributes[name]
        raise AttributeError(f"{name} not found")
    
    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if name == '_attributes':
            super().__setattr__(name, value)
        else:
            self._attributes[name] = value
    
    def __delattr__(self, name):
        if name in self._attributes:
            del self._attributes[name]
        else:
            raise AttributeError(f"{name} not found")

# Usage
obj = DynamicAttributes()
obj.x = 10
obj.y = 20
print(obj.x)  # 10
del obj.x
try:
    print(obj.x)  # Raises AttributeError
except AttributeError as e:
    print(e)  # x not found
```

### Descriptors

Descriptors are objects that define how attributes are accessed. They implement the descriptor protocol, which consists of `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__` methods.

```python
class Validator:
    def __init__(self, name, min_value, max_value):
        self.name = name
        self.min_value = min_value
        self.max_value = max_value
    
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        if instance is None:
            return self
        return instance.__dict__.get(self.name, None)
    
    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        if not isinstance(value, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError(f"{self.name} must be a number")
        if value < self.min_value or value > self.max_value:
            raise ValueError(f"{self.name} must be between {self.min_value} and {self.max_value}")
        instance.__dict__[self.name] = value
    
    def __delete__(self, instance):
        if self.name in instance.__dict__:
            del instance.__dict__[self.name]

class Person:
    age = Validator('age', 0, 120)
    height = Validator('height', 0, 300)
    
    def __init__(self, name, age, height):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.height = height

# Usage
person = Person("Alice", 30, 170)
print(person.age)  # 30

try:
    person.age = -1  # Raises ValueError
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # age must be between 0 and 120

try:
    person.height = "tall"  # Raises TypeError
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # height must be a number
```

### Abstract Base Classes

Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) define interfaces that derived classes must implement. They are a form of metaprogramming that enforces a contract on subclasses.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        import math
        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2
    
    def perimeter(self):
        import math
        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius

# Usage
rect = Rectangle(5, 3)
print(rect.area())  # 15
print(rect.perimeter())  # 16

circle = Circle(2)
print(circle.area())  # 12.566370614359172
print(circle.perimeter())  # 12.566370614359172

try:
    shape = Shape()  # Raises TypeError
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Can't instantiate abstract class Shape with abstract methods area, perimeter
```

## Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming allows you to write concurrent code that can perform multiple operations without blocking the main thread. Python provides the `asyncio` module for asynchronous programming.

### Coroutines and `async`/`await`

Coroutines are functions that can be paused and resumed. They are defined using the `async` keyword and can use the `await` keyword to pause execution until an awaitable completes.

```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello(name, delay):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)  # Non-blocking sleep
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    return f"{name} greeted"

async def main():
    # Run coroutines concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        say_hello("Alice", 1),
        say_hello("Bob", 2),
        say_hello("Charlie", 3)
    )
    print(results)

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Asynchronous Context Managers

Context managers can also be asynchronous, allowing them to be used with the `async with` statement.

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncContextManager:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        print("Entering context")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate async setup
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Exiting context")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate async cleanup
        return False  # Don't suppress exceptions

async def main():
    async with AsyncContextManager() as manager:
        print("Inside context")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate async work

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Asynchronous Iterators

Iterators can also be asynchronous, allowing them to be used with the `async for` statement.

```python
import asyncio

class AsyncIterator:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
    
    def __aiter__(self):
        return self
    
    async def __anext__(self):
        if self.start >= self.end:
            raise StopAsyncIteration
        self.start += 1
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate async work
        return self.start - 1

async def main():
    async for i in AsyncIterator(0, 5):
        print(i)

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Asynchronous Generators

Generators can also be asynchronous, allowing them to yield values asynchronously.

```python
import asyncio

async def async_generator(start, end):
    for i in range(start, end):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate async work
        yield i

async def main():
    async for i in async_generator(0, 5):
        print(i)

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Asynchronous Comprehensions

Python 3.6+ supports asynchronous comprehensions, allowing you to create lists, sets, and dictionaries using asynchronous expressions.

```python
import asyncio

async def get_value(i):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate async work
    return i * 2

async def main():
    # Asynchronous list comprehension
    result = [await get_value(i) for i in range(5)]
    print(result)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
    
    # Asynchronous generator expression
    result = [i async for i in async_generator(0, 5)]
    print(result)  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    # Asynchronous dictionary comprehension
    result = {i: await get_value(i) for i in range(5)}
    print(result)  # {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 8}

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Asynchronous I/O

The `asyncio` module provides functions for asynchronous I/O operations, such as reading from and writing to files, sockets, and pipes.

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_url(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()

async def main():
    urls = [
        "https://www.example.com",
        "https://www.example.org",
        "https://www.example.net"
    ]
    
    # Fetch URLs concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[fetch_url(url) for url in urls])
    
    # Print the lengths of the responses
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        print(f"URL {urls[i]} returned {len(result)} bytes")

# Run the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
```
